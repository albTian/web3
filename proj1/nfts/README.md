# How to update after changing CANDY MACHINE (project 5)
Do these everytine you want to change your candy machine
1. `rm -rf .cache` Delete the `.cache` folder that was generated by the Metaplex CLI's candy machine commands.
2. Change `assets` to new NFTs
3. `python scripts.py` (upload, verify, create_candy_machine, update_candy_machine)
4. Update `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables
   1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDY_MACHINE_CONFIG` -> `.cache/devnet-temp` -> `config`
   2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDY_MACHINE_ID` -> `.cache/devnet-temp` -> `candyMachineAddress`
   3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS` -> `.cache/devnet-temp` -> `authority`
   4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK` -> `devnet`
   5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_HOST` -> https://explorer-api.devnet.solana.com
If you mess up even one of these steps, everything will break. So, watch out.
